# Oyster Subgraph

## Installation

You can use the `npm install` or `yarn` command to install, but we recommend using `yarn`.

## Deployment

This code supports multi-network deployment, generated by Mocha based on templates. If you need to expand a network, simply add a configuration for the new network under the config folder.


### Deploy on [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio)

```shell
# generate codes based on templates for different networks
npm run templatize --network=blast
graph codegen
graph build
graph auth --studio $your_deploy_key
graph deploy --studio $your_subgraph_slug
```

### Deploy on Self-Hosted Graph Node

```shell
# generate codes based on templates for different networks
npm run templatize --network=blast
graph codegen
graph build

graph create --node $node_endPoint $team_name/$subgraph_name
graph deploy --node $node_endPoint --ipfs $ipfs_endPoint --version-label v0.0.1 $team_name/$subgraph_name
